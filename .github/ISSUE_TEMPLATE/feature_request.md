## 📋 Detailed Description

**Proposed Solution**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Use Case Example**
```python

# Expected behavior
assert result.confidence > 0.8
assert result.reasoning_steps
```

**API Design** (if applicable)
```python
# Proposed function signatures, class definitions, etc.
def new_reasoning_function(
    input_data: List[Any],
    reasoning_chain: Optional[ReasoningChain] = None,
    confidence_threshold: float = 0.7
) -> ReasoningResult:
    """Proposed function documentation."""
    pass
```
