## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Reasoning Library seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of these channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/reasoning_library/reasoning_library/security) in our repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

2. **Email** (Alternative)
   - Send details to: security@reasoning-library.org
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Use PGP encryption if possible (key available on request)

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

```
**Summary**: Brief description of the vulnerability
**Component**: Which part of the system is affected
**Severity**: Your assessment of the impact
**Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
**Impact**: Potential consequences if exploited
**Mitigation**: Any temporary workarounds you've identified
**Discovery**: How you discovered this vulnerability
```

### Example Report Template

```markdown
## Vulnerability Report

**Summary**: Code injection vulnerability in reasoning chain processing

**Component**: src/reasoning_library/core.py - ReasoningStep.description field

**Severity**: High

**Reproduction**:
1. Create a ReasoningStep with malicious input in description
2. Call get_summary() method
3. Observe code execution

**Impact**:
- Arbitrary code execution in host environment
- Potential data exfiltration
- Compromise of reasoning chain integrity

**Mitigation**:
- Input sanitization before processing
- Validate all user-provided content

**Discovery**: Found during security audit of string processing
```

## ‚è∞ Response Timeline

We are committed to responding promptly to security reports:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

## üîç Security Measures

### Current Security Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - All external inputs are validated and sanitized
   - Regex complexity limits prevent ReDoS attacks
   - Type checking enforces data integrity

2. **Dependency Security**
   - Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Regular updates to maintain security
   - Supply chain security verification

3. **Code Security**
   - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with bandit and semgrep
   - Security-focused code reviews
   - Secure coding practices throughout

4. **Infrastructure Security**
   - GitHub Actions with minimal permissions
   - OIDC trusted publishing for package releases
   - Automated security monitoring

### Threat Model

The Reasoning Library operates in environments where:

- **Input Data**: May come from untrusted sources
- **Execution Context**: Runs in shared or sandboxed environments
- **Integration**: Connects with external LLM services
- **Output**: Generates reasoning chains that may be stored or transmitted

## üèÜ Security Best Practices for Users

### Safe Usage Guidelines

1. **Input Sanitization**
   ```python
   # ‚úÖ Safe: Validate inputs
   def safe_reasoning(user_input: str) -> ReasoningChain:
       if not isinstance(user_input, str):
           raise ValueError("Input must be string")
       if len(user_input) > 10000:  # Reasonable limit
           raise ValueError("Input too long")
       return process_reasoning(user_input)

   # ‚ùå Unsafe: Direct use of untrusted input
   reasoning_chain = ReasoningChain()
   reasoning_chain.add_step("user", untrusted_input, result)
   ```

2. **Environment Isolation**
   - Run in sandboxed environments when processing untrusted data
   - Limit file system and network access appropriately
   - Monitor resource usage to prevent DoS attacks

3. **LLM Integration Security**
   - Validate all LLM API responses
   - Implement rate limiting and timeout controls
   - Protect API keys and credentials properly

### Common Security Pitfalls

‚ùå **Don't do this:**
```python
# Unsafe: Direct evaluation of user input
exec(user_reasoning_code)

# Unsafe: Unvalidated regex with user input
re.match(user_pattern, data)

# Unsafe: Direct inclusion in tool specs
tool_spec = {"description": user_description}
```

‚úÖ **Do this instead:**
```python
# Safe: Use provided validation functions
reasoning_chain = validate_and_process(user_input)

# Safe: Use pre-defined patterns only
pattern = SAFE_PATTERNS.get(user_choice, DEFAULT_PATTERN)

# Safe: Sanitize before inclusion
tool_spec = {"description": sanitize_description(user_description)}
```

## üîß Security Configuration

### Recommended Security Settings

```python
# Example secure configuration
reasoning_config = {
    "max_input_length": 10000,
    "timeout_seconds": 30,
    "enable_validation": True,
    "strict_mode": True,
    "sanitize_output": True
}
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security-related environment variables
REASONING_STRICT_MODE=true
REASONING_MAX_STEPS=100
REASONING_TIMEOUT=30
```
